# SAFE-T1002: Supply Chain Compromise

## Overview
**Tactic**: Initial Access (ATK-TA0001)  
**Technique ID**: SAFE-T1002  
**Severity**: High  
**First Observed**: March 2024 (Discovered via namesquatting attacks on Hugging Face AI model repositories)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-15

## Description
Supply Chain Compromise is a technique where adversaries tamper with MCP server packages, dependencies, or build processes to distribute backdoored or malicious versions through legitimate channels. This exploits the trust users place in package repositories and supply chains, enabling initial access when compromised components are installed and executed in MCP environments.

Adversaries leverage differences in build environments, repository access controls, and dependency resolution to inject malicious code. For instance, they may compromise upstream libraries used by MCP implementations or use namesquatting to mimic popular MCP tool names, leading to unintended installation of backdoored servers that expose hidden capabilities to attackers.

## Attack Vectors
- **Primary Vector**: Distribution of backdoored MCP packages through compromised repositories like PyPI or npm
- **Secondary Vectors**: 
  - Namesquatting/typosquatting on MCP-related package names
  - Compromise of build pipelines or CI/CD systems for legitimate MCP projects
  - Injection into third-party dependencies integrated with MCP servers
  - **Malicious Updates**: Pushing tainted updates to existing packages via compromised maintainer accounts

## Technical Details

### Prerequisites
- Access to package repositories, build systems, or maintainer credentials
- Knowledge of MCP package ecosystem and dependency graphs

    style D fill:#e5f9d5,stroke:#4dee6c
    style E fill:#e5f9d5,stroke:#4dee6c
```

1. **Initial Stage**: Adversary compromises a supply chain element, such as injecting malware into a dependency or uploading a backdoored package
2. **Distribution**: Compromised package is made available through official or mirrored repositories
3. **Installation**: Users install the tainted package during MCP setup or updates
4. **Exploitation Stage**: Backdoor activates, registering malicious tools or granting remote access
5. **Post-Exploitation**: Attacker uses the foothold for further operations, such as data exfiltration

### Example Scenario
```json
// Example of a backdoored MCP package manifest (simplified)
{
  "name": "mcp-server-legit",  // Namesquatted to mimic legitimate package
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "description": "Standard MCP server implementation",
  "dependencies": {
    "backdoor-lib": "^0.1.0"  // Injected malicious dependency
  },
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node backdoor.js"  // Executes backdoor on install
  }
}
```

### Proof of Concept Examples
We provide examples to demonstrate and detect this technique:

1. **[Backdoored MCP Package PoC](examples/backdoored-package.py)**: Demonstrates namesquatting and dependency injection methods, including post-install scripts and hidden backdoors
2. **[Supply Chain Detector](examples/supply-chain-detector.py)**: Scans dependencies for known malicious indicators; usage: python examples/supply-chain-detector.py [package.json]

```python
# Example PoC snippet for detecting suspicious dependencies
import json

def detect_backdoor(manifest):
    if 'postinstall' in manifest.get('scripts', {}):
        print("Warning: Post-install script detected - potential backdoor")
    for dep in manifest.get('dependencies', {}):
        if 'backdoor' in dep.lower():
            print(f"Malicious dependency detected: {dep}")

with open('package.json') as f:
    manifest = json.load(f)
    detect_backdoor(manifest)
```

### Advanced Attack Techniques (2024-2025 Research)

#### Namesquatting and Typosquatting (2024 Research)
According to research from Protect AI and others, attackers exploit package naming conventions:

1. **Variation 1**: Creating packages with similar names to popular MCP tools (e.g., "mcp-serve" vs. "mcp-server") to deliver malware ([Unveiling AI/ML Supply Chain Attacks - Protect AI, 2024](https://protectai.com/threat-research/unveiling-ai-supply-chain-attacks-on-hugging-face))
2. **Variation 2**: Injecting into AI model repositories like Hugging Face for downstream compromise ([Malice In Chains - Bonner & Janus, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1moD2zoAyaU))

#### MCP-Specific Supply Chain Evolution (2025)
##### Dynamic Dependency Injection
Attackers compromise MCP build processes to insert runtime dependencies ([MCP Security 101 - Protect AI, 2025](https://protectai.com/blog/mcp-security-101))

##### Compromised Update Channels
Exploiting auto-update mechanisms in MCP tools to deliver backdoored versions post-installation ([The 2025 Software Supply Chain Security Report, 2025](https://ntsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-2025-Software-Supply-Chain-Security-Report-RL-compressed.pdf))

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Backdoors enable data leakage from MCP environments
- **Integrity**: High - Tampered code alters MCP behavior and tool executions
- **Availability**: Medium - Compromised packages may cause crashes or DoS
- **Scope**: Network-wide - Affects all systems installing the tainted package

### Current Status (2025)
According to security researchers, organizations are beginning to implement mitigations aligned with established frameworks like SLSA and NIST SP 800-204D:
- Adoption of SLSA Level 2+ practices, including tamper-proof builds and provenance generation for MCP packages ([SLSA Framework, 2023](https://slsa.dev/))
- Integration of NIST SP 800-204D strategies, such as secure build isolation and automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines ([NIST SP 800-204D, 2024](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-204D.pdf))
- Tools like MCP-Scan now include supply chain checks ([Invariant Labs, 2025](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/introducing-mcp-scan))

However, new vectors like AI-specific dependency graphs continue to emerge, as seen in the mcp-remote vulnerability exploitation patterns.

## Detection Methods

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Unexpected post-install scripts or dependencies in MCP packages
- Package names with subtle variations from known legitimate ones
- Anomalous network connections from installed MCP servers
- Discrepancies in package hashes or provenance compared to official sources

### Detection Rules

**Important**: Rules are examples only. Attackers evolve techniques; organizations should:
- Use AI-based anomaly detection for novel patterns
- Update rules via threat intelligence
- Layer detections (e.g., pattern + semantic analysis)
- Consider dependency graph analysis for MCP ecosystems

#### AI-Based Anomaly Detection Examples
```yaml
# Example: Dependency anomaly detection
- name: dependency_anomaly
  type: ai_analysis
  model: supply-chain-bert
  indicators:
    - "Unusual dependency names or versions"
    - "Presence of post-install scripts in non-build packages"

# Example: Behavioral analysis
- name: install_behavior
  type: statistical_analysis
  baseline_window: 7_days
  indicators:
    - "Unexpected network activity post-install"
    - "Anomalous file modifications during package setup"
```
